<h2> Emoji Avatar from Face Expressions </h2>
We will build a deep learning model to classify facial expressions from the images. Then we will map the classified emotion to a predefined avatar. <h4>Emotions which will be detected by the model can be divided into seven broad categories — Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Neutral, Sad and Surprised. </h4>
